# Updates and 2023 Goals!

## Update

2022 was a bit crazy for me and had a lot of things going on. I basically finished my associates degree in December/January and then immediately jumped into a bachelor's degree program. The bachelor's degree is self paced so finishing it faster allows me to save some money ... so that's where basically all my focus went. 
  
I was able to accomplish a few of the goals for 2022, but actually had to tear some of it down because of schooling or neglect parts of it. So I half did most of what was on the list for 2022. I built the homelab, but test proctors did not like the servers and networking equipment sitting on my desk during testing so I had to dissassemble and reassmble anytime I took a test. That got tiresome so the homelab needs rebuilt. I did jump deeper into the programming courses I have, but did not finish as I was focusing on school work.

I was able to basically finish my degree and get 3 more certifications in two semesters. I have a capstone to write and then I'm finished I will have a bachelor's in cybersecurity from WGU. 

Parts of everything have been started or attempted, but nothing has been finished. When I first started all this everything seemed interesting to me and I wasn't sure what I really wanted to do in Cybersecurity just that it's always interested me and I'd like to try it. After going through all the courses I think what ended up interesting me the most was malware/exploit development and reverse engineering. 

To me it's kinda like seeing how a magic trick is done, you get to see how they are compromising the system and evading antivirus and all these protections we now have. So I'm hoping to finish the PNPT and then focus on malware/reverse engineering. While doing all that hoping to hammer down the fundamenals and make it easier to recall and understand what is going on, e.g. networking, windows, linux, basic programming, how the internet works, cloud technologies, etc...

# 2023 Goals

- [ ] Learn C/C++

    I have gone through parts of both courses on udemy I had purchased. What I really need to do is focus on just one programming language. Python will probably take a backburner for now unless I find I need it for something like PNPT or work. I will probably focus on C and start there then transition into C++ after I feel I have a good handle on C. I heard it's a good place to start for the malware/reverse engineering things and see how everything works. 

- [ ] Finish Python Udemy Course

    I assume I will eventually finish this. It has been insanely helpful and has allowed me to read programs and determine what they are doing better. Giant help with the pentest+ as I understood the basics of what was going on with this class, it's just different syntax for the different languages. I would like to finish but again not currently a priority

- [ ] Get into reverse engineering

    I have a class from TCM security for this that I started before going through some of the PNPT material. I ran and executed my first sample without ransom-wareing my own computer so that's a plus. I have not been able to get into it much and would like to get back to it. Probably finish the PNPT first as I started it when studying for the pentest+ and I'd like to just keep that moment alive at the moment. 

- [ ] Finish Bachelor’s degree

    I have the capstone to finish and I'm done. I've updated my resume and have started looking at what jobs may be out there. Almost there. 

- [ ] Bug Bounties

    I had purchased that Nahamesec class when I first started my associates about a year and a half ago watched all the videos and haven't really done any of the labs. I do have a tryhackme subscription that I did do some burpsuite stuff, but haven't gotten into it much. I would like to get deeper into it and practice but currently PNPT and Bachelor's are priority. Might get into it if I get some free time and I get burnt out on the other things. Was thinking it would be a good way to make some side cash, so might do that as also a way to practice for the PNPT not really sure. 

- [ ] Participate in more CTF’s and apply myself better

    This I need to do. I've signed up for the National Cyber League twice and only completed like 2 items before I got distracted and moved away. I figured actually paying for them would force me to pay attention and do them, but that's not true. I actually did more during a pico ctf then I did for either of these. I have the knowledge now I need to apply it and prove I can do these things. 

- [ ] Participate a game jam

    This has always been a bit of a dream but not sure what I would really be able to contribute. While this is a goal it's not super important at the moment. Probably take a back seat to almost everything else on this list. This may be a goal more for after going through some of my programming courses. 

- [ ] Finish the PNPT before 2024

    This is a goal I'm hoping to really accomplish. I'm not far into the PNPT material currently but thinking maybe about streaming some practice on twitch or something. I probably can't put the material on twitch but maybe doing some of the labs live kind of thing. 

- [ ] Stream on twitch/YouTube

    I got OBS working and tested to verify everything did in fact stream correctly. I have not actually streamed to twitch yet. Could probably do some try hackme, magic arena, or league. Not sure what if anything I want to do with it.  

- [ ] Build a NAS

    This may not come this year but if I can get my next pc built out and ordered, maybe. I was able to get some hard drives that were going to be thrown away so I have like 8 1 tb hard drives I can use for a NAS. I would just use my old computer as it has a big case, the space, and the motherboard has enough connections for those hard drives. 

- [ ] Rebuild homelab

    As I said above homelab was started. I built it created a server. Found out my ISP uses something called carrier grade NAT, and that's why none of my friends could connect to my server. Also probably why no matter how much I try to get a ebook library or vscode server up for remote access nothing works. I need to get everything set back up update everything and try again. This will be pretty easy probably just need to buckle down and do it. 

- [ ] Learn Linux "better"

    I'm always having to look things up, but it's not a daily driver for me, and I don't normally use only the command line for a lot of stuff. I actually did practice and do know a lot more than I did last year. However, you can always be better at something. So I'll add this to the list again because I'm proficient but can always benefit at understanding and performing things better. 

- [ ] Learn Windows "better"

    I daily drive windows at home and work. I felt proficient with it until getting into IT and doing more of the pentest side of things. There is so much going on in the background I didn't know about or understand. Would like to learn windows internals and I genuinely think it would benefit me to get a deeper understanding of how everything works for the malware/reverse engineering. A [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/@OffByOneSecurity) I watch that does the SANS Exploit development courses mentioned building a windows driver and testing buffer overflows with older versions of windows for practice. This ties into the malware and reverse engineering I was talking about that interested me. A deeper understanding definitley could not hurt. 

- [ ] Learn Cloud and study for CCSP

    Degree program offered CCSP voucher so I had scheduled it for some time in June. I need to study hard for this one as I'm not big on cloud and have only dabbled in some things. I can set up an account and understand the concepts, but probably could not put any of it into practice. Need to focus on studying for that before June after my Capstone. I do not have the 5 years required for the cert, but it was offered and I paid tuition so it seemed stupid not to at least try and get it.
