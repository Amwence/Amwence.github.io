# My first blog post


## First blog post in the bag.

Hello this is my first blog, I have no idea what I'm doing or what I want to do with this, but decided to just get started. I'm a cybersecurity student, Dad/Husband, and Nerd with a terrible sense of humor. I apologize for any terrible jokes in advance. 

## I'm interested in

Cybersecurity, programming, videogames, terrible horror movies, and a plethora of other things. I'm not much of a writer, so a lot of things will just be me rambling, because that's exactly what I'm doing. 

I'm currently working on learning python, setting up a homelab, and trying to break into the Security side of IT. All while raising a 2 year old and working full time. I have a problem with wanting to do to many things at once, and trying to run before I can crawl, so some posts may be me complaining about some problem I've created myself. Which may be my unintentional super power, creating problems for myself. 

I believe I want to use this space to track where I am with things, post what I've learned, problems I've encountered, and how I overcame them. It will probably be alot of things I'm interested in at the time, and then forgotten about until I remember "Oh yeah, I was actually gonna do that thingâ„¢".


*(I've actually come back to edit this, because while trying to figure out how to set up a note taking app that I could access anywhere, I accidentally learned Markdown)*
