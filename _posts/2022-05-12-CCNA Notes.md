# CCNA Notes

I've just today updated my CCNA notes from when I took the test in December last year. When I first took all my notes on github I had no idea how it worked, and just made files and saved them, not understanding anything about how github worked. I have since changed all of them to markdown and formatted them so that they make more sense. I plan on eventually just adding them as a repository to this page, but until I figure that out they can be found here. Also take them with a grain of salt. There will be misspellings and bad information. Either I misunderstood something, or am just flat out wrong on how it works. I did take a lot of info from Cisco's site, so hopefully it's not to far off.
