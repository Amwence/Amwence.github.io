Other goals will be added later, and I'm hoping that I can remember to come back and check the one's I've actually acomplished. 

*Update:*
*Most of these have been started because I have the attention span of a potato and jump on to the next thing, but I did get that server working. Now it's just a matter of getting things set the way I want and knowing enough to actually secure it. Need to get that PFsense box set up correctly.*

*I did start a course from TCM security academy on Reverse Engineering and Malware analysis. I got my lab all set up and detonated my first ransomware sample, and .... that's about as far as I got before something else pulled my attention away. I will get back to it, but I have since started a bacehelor's program and am again short on time.*
